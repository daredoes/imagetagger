This program exists to serve its purpose. I hope it helps you fulfill your own purposes. Please feel free to modify and use however.

To execute this program simply run the python script watermark.py

The program currently has a basic console to help get information. I would recommend any programmer delete the console and write their own function for speedy use. Otherwise, this program will work well enough.

Required Files:

A watermark image that contains transparency, and is named 'watermark.png'

A '.ttf' or '.otf' font file, any name

The pre-existing folders, 'watermarked' and 'tagged'
